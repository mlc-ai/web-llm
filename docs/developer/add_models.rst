Adding Models
=============

WebLLM allows you to compile custom language models using `MLC-LLM <https://llm.mlc.ai/>`_ and then serve the compiled model through WebLLM.

For instructions on how to compile and add custom models to WebLLM, please refer to the `MLC-LLM documentation <https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/deploy/webllm.html>`_.
