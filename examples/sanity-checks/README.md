# Sanity Checks for Generated Output

This folder provides simple sanity checks on the output generated
using WebLLM. To try it out, you can do the following steps under this folder

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Note if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.
You can change web-llm dependencies as `"file:../.."`, and follow the build from source
instruction in the project to build webllm locally. This option is only recommended
if you would like to hack WebLLM core package.
